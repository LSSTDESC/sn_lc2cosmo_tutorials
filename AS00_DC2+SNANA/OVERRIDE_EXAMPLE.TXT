To handle unanticipated data updates bewtween official releases,
here is an illustration using the override feature:

  ls $SNANA_LSST_ROOT/lcmerge/DC2_run22i_FITS/OVERRIDE*

OVERRIDE.LIST is a list of all override files, and this example
shows overrides for a few redshifts, coordinates, and host galaxies.
At the start of each data file release, OVERRIDE.LIST is empty ..
and then it may grow slowly as data-file mistakes are found.
The FITS files and OVERRIDE files should be maintained by a
specific sub-group with clear responsibility.
[SNANA does not read these OVERRIDE files (yet?), so the AS1-5
 examples are not disturbed by these extra files]

A tricky issue concerns archiving data for a publication or for public
results via seminar of conferences. Do we allow results that use
override files, or require that public results are based on a clean
data version with no overrides? What if an analysis has three
stages, and each stage was performed on a different data version?
Do we require that all analysis stages be repeated on a single
data version ? Using a single data version is ideal, but students
often use labor intensive methods, not realizing that it might have
to be repeated later.
