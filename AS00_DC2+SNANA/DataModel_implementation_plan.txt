    Discussion: Data Tagging and Overrides
             Jun 18 2021

An explicit example of data-override implementation
is on Cori:
   $SNANA_LSST/ROOT/starterKits/DC2+SNANA/AS0/OVERRIDE_EXAMPLE.TXT

This examples allows stability by analyzing FITS data files from
original data release (DR), and it allows using supplmental OVERRIDE
files that includes fixes between data releases. With each new DR,
the override list is reset to empty. Below are issues from today's
discussion.

Challenges:
  * knowing if/what overrides are used in any particular analysis
     -> each software reader (SNcosmo,SNANA ...) should write
        a standard "this is what I read" block in stdout.
  * tracking asyncronous code tags and DR tags
  * analysis leads should be prepared to re-run analysis on tagged DR
    before a Significant Result Presentation (SRP) such as publication,
    prelim presentation at conference or collab meeting, sprint week, etc ...
  * Data team (e.g., 2 people for 3 month shifts) should have tools
    to rapidly make new DR as needed for finalizing analysis; i.e.,
    people should not be forced to wait a long time to re-analyze on
    a newly minted DR tag.
  *   
DR properties:
  * no overrides
  * change-log w.r.t. previous version
  * passes monitoring and validation tests (separate discussion for later)
  * higher level pub doc should match publication to DR tag  
     [what about matching SRP (not publication) to DR tag?]

Code readers:
 * Need standard python I/O.
 * SNANA (c-code)
 * All code readers should write standard description (tag, overrides ...)
   to STDOUT.

Tutorial notebooks ?

Significant Result Presentation :
  Who decides if data version/tag is adequate, or of analysis needs
  to be re-run on current data tag ? IR and/or WG leaders ?
  What policy underlies such a decision ?
  
DESC/SN leadership needs to set culture of preparing for
rapid reproducibility.
